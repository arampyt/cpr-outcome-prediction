# CPR-outcome-prediction  

Greetings,

This codebase is a result of our research on CPR outcome prediction, and we will provide the article link once it's published.

## Overview

The code is designed for analyzing data using various machine learning algorithms, including:

- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Multinomial Logistic Regression
- Artificial Neural Network

The primary goal is to compare the effectiveness of these algorithms in predicting CPR outcomes.
## New Data Prediction
1. Input Data:

Provide the required input data to the model. Ensure that the input features align with the variables the model was trained on.  
2. Preprocessing:

Preprocess the input data as per the model's requirements. This may include scaling, normalization, or any other necessary transformations.  
3. Run Prediction:

Apply the input data to the trained model. This typically involves using a function or method provided by the model to obtain predictions.

## Final Thoughts

This code serves as a valuable tool in predicting CPR outcomes based on our research findings. We encourage you to explore its capabilities, adapt it to your specific requirements, and contribute to the ongoing advancements in CPR outcome prediction.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further assistance. Happy coding!
